JavaScript powers most online maps these days. During this evening we'll cover the mapping library [Leaflet.js](http://leafletjs.com/) .
Never written a line of code before? Don't worry! This workshop is for all skill levels!
During the workshop, we create an interactive, online map together taking one step at a time!
