JavaScript powers most online maps these days. During this evening we'll cover the two primary mapping libraries [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) and [Leaflet.js](http://leafletjs.com/) .
Never written a line of code before? Don't worry! This workshop is for all skill levels!
During the workshop, we create an interactive, online map together taking one step at a time! So bring your laptop to join in.
