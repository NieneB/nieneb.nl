<!--more-->

Soft map, where routes are spreading like fungi/mycelium threads. 

Indication of place but no hard lines... Between art and recognizable places. 

All based on hard Geo Data.


<i> a point does not have to be a point, a line does not have to be a line and a polygon does not have to be a polygon. </i>

Have a look at some nice screenshots of the map:

Or visit the map itself and explore Amsterdam as seen by Arita Baaijens:
