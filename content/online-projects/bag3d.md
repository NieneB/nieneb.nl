<!--more-->

To continue the [previous map](/online-projects/gebouwen/) with building heights of the Netherlands based on the Top10NL 3D . [This map](https://apps.webmapper.nl/bag_3D/) shows the BAG 3D from [TU Delft](http://3dbag.bk.tudelft.nl/). An amazing dataset which is way more detailed and up to date! 

Tiles were made with [Tegola](https://tegola.io/) and added to our [Cartiqo](https://cartiqo.nl) stack. The map is developed with [MapboxGL.js](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/)

At [Foss4G-NL 2019](https://foss4g.nl/) my map was used as the background for their promotion materials! [Matthew Petroff](http://mpetroff.net/) build a tool <i class="fa fa-github"></i> [print maps](https://github.com/mpetroff/print-maps) to export MapboxGL maps to hight resolution images for printing. I <i class="fa fa-github"></i> [forked this tool](https://github.com/NieneB/print-maps) to insert my own map on order to export a high resolution image to make the banner from.
