My mega project from last year: Making a dress with NeoPixel LEDs! 
Combining my sewing hobby with a RaspberryPi and LED strips.

#### The sewing process of my dress:

#### 6 layer petticoat from Tule and Organza fabric. 

Each layer exists out of:

* Tule Circle skirt. Diameter of 75cm. Inner circle diameter of 25cm. Height 25 cm. 
* Tule Strip 30 cm x 500 cm
* Decoration ruffle strip of Organza fabric (3 diff colours): 750cm x 10cm

First cut all coloured strips of the organza and hemmed them with silver thread. Using a hemming foot on my old sixties sewing machine. That is 6 x 7,5 meters of hemming! 

Then cut the tule strips. 6 x 5 meter. 25cm wide.
and 6 x circle skirt 25 wide. Diameter of 75cm. Inner circle diameter of 25cm. For my taille circumference is 76cm. `76 / pi = 24.2cm` 
The outer circumference becomes `75 * pi = 235cm`

Then attached the coloured organza strips to the tule strip. Ruffling them up along the way. Same as the tule strip to the circle skirt. 

I cut a 15 cm opening in the circle skirts so I can slip it over my hips. 
Hip circumference is 105 cm. So `105-76 = 29` Needing a cut of `29/2 = 14.5cm`.

The I sewed them all together at the top. 

#### 4 dress layers of Organza fabric and 1 lining layer. 

In total the dress has 4 layers on top of the petticoat. I also added one lining layer underneath the petty coat.

From bottom to top:

| layer | circle skirt 	| length 	| color | circ waist | diameter | radius |
|-------|---------------|-----------|-------|------------| -------- |--------|
| 1 	| full 			| 55 cm		| pink	| 79cm  	 | 25.15 	| 12.6   |
| 2		| 1.3 			| 50 cm 	| white | 26.33 	 | - 		| 		 | * usd full pattern
| 3		| double 		| 40 cm 	| white | 39.5  	 | 12.6 	| 6.3    |
| 4		| 4 			| 30 cm		| white | 19.75 	 | 6.2 		| 3.15   |

Hemmed everything with pink thread and a plastic (fishing) thread. To make the fabric get a firmer wave at the bottom. 

#### Backup lights 

Because I was afraid the Led lights won't last all evening (or I didn't have faith it would work out at all.. ) I installed some simple lights in the petticoat. It was around Christmas time so a lot of simple cheap led lights on batteries could be found in the store. I used 3 strings of white led lights and sewn them in the dress. Already a beautiful effect! The small battery packs hang in little sacks sewn to the waste underneath the petticoat layers.

#### Top

The top is made from lining, tule and organza fabric. Desing based on a pattern I found from another dress and changed to my own sizes and likening. 

The top 4 layers from the dress are sewn to the top with a pink band in the middle. 

The petticoat is separate and has its own closure. 

#### Decoration

Decoration exists out of roses I made from left over pieces of organza fabric. I also found some white glitter leaves in the christmas decoration in the sale. 
All sew on by hand.
