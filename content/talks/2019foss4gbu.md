Vector tiles are a challenge for the creative mind. In this talk we will take you along the path of making artistic styles for your vector tiles like this Crafty map, this 1940 style map and the Paradise in the Polder map. Starting from the importance of having a good and clear tile set to making your own sprites and glyphs with command line tools and software like Inkscape and Gimp. After that we show some trick to add animation with Turf.js and D3.js. Like placing random hot air balloons all over your map! Vector tiles are on the cutting edge of technology and creativity, we combine both to show you the endless possibilities that vector tiles offer!
