Present-day, maps are no longer printed on paper, 2D and flat. Maps are dynamic, interactive and online. We no longer go to maps to find out where we are. Instead, the maps tell us where we are and they form advanced around us on the fly. Web Cartography overlaps the worlds of GIS, Web Technology and Design. A modern cartographer has to be able to find, manipulate and store geo-spatial data, design the functional and cartographic representation of the map and implement this all through code! In this talk Niene will take you through the Web Map Universe, beyond Google Maps.
